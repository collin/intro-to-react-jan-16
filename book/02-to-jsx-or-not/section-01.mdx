<Objectives>
In this section, you will:

- Read the React documentation for the `createElement` function.
- Write a React component without using JSX.

</Objectives>

<ReadDocs
  url="https://react.dev/reference/react/createElement#createelement"
  title={<>Read the documentation for `React.createElement`</>}
>
  There are some interactive code examples in the documentation. Try them out!
  But don't forget to come back and complete the lab ðŸ˜€
</ReadDocs>

Open the file `labs/02-to-jsx-or-not/your-solution/NoJSX.js` in your editor.

In the file `NoJSX.js`, there is an empty React component.

```js NoJSX.js
export const NoJSX = () => {
  return null;
};
```

It's okay for a React component to return `null`. It not display as anything.
But it's not very useful.

The first thing for you to do is update that component to return a React element
created with `React.createElement`.

<Activity>
  Change the `NoJSX` function to return an `h1` element with the contents `"Huh,
  no JSX here!"`

<Hint title="Can't find the `createElement` function?">

You'll need to import it from the `react` package.

```js
import { createElement } from "react";
```

</Hint>
<Hint title="Not sure how to use the `createElement` function?">

You'll need to call create element with three arguments:

1. The type of element you want to create. In this case, it's the string `"h1"`.
2. An object with the props you want to pass to the element. In this case, it's
   an empty object.
3. The children of the element. In this case, it's a string with the contents
   `"Huh, no JSX here!"`.

```js
createElement("h1", {}, "Huh, no JSX here!");
```

</Hint>
</Activity>

<Activity>
  Change the `NoJSX` function to return an `ol` element with three `li` children.

<Hint title="Not sure how to nest the elements">

You can nest the elements by passing them as the third, fourth, and fifth argument to
`createElement`.

```js
createElement(
  "ol",
  {},
  createElement("li", {}, "First"),
  createElement("li", {}, "Second"),
  createElement("li", {}, "Third"),
);
```

</Hint>

<Hint title={<>Getting an error about `unique "key" prop`</>}>

There's a subtle difference between:

```js
createElement("div", {}, "First", "Second", "Third");
```

and

```js
createElement("div", {}, ["First", "Second", "Third"]);
```

The first example creates a `div` with three children. The second example creates a `div` with one child, which is an array of three strings.

React treats these two cases differently. We'll cover the `key` prop in a later lab. For now, you can fix the error by unwrapping the array.

<Goal>
  Congratulations! You've written your first React component without using JSX.

  <sub>
    In practice, it's rare that you'll need to use `React.createElement` directly.
    But it's good to understand that your JSX is getting compiled to this function.

    When people say that React is "just JavaScript", this is what they mean.
