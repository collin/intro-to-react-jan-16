To the right side of this page is a live preview of what you'll be working on
in this lab. The code for this lab is in the file `labs/07-react-router-dom/your-solution/02-url-params`;

In the previous section, we used routes to navigate between pages with static content.

In this section, we'll use routes with url params to fetch dynamic content.

Having an index or directory page linking to individual item pages is a common pattern in web applications.

For example a blog might have a url: `/all-posts`, which lists all the posts, and a url: `/post/1` which shows the post with the id 1 (or whichever number was in the url).

React Router allows for specifying url params in the route path, and accessing them in the component via the `useParams` hook.

The way to specify a dynamic route is to use a colon `:` followed by the name of the param.

For examlpe:

```jsx
<Route path="/all-posts">
<Rotue path="/post/:postId">
```

Could be use to match the following urls:

```txt
/all-posts
/post/1 <- with postId = 1
/post/2 <- with postId = 2
/post/3 <- with postId = 3
```

In this section, we're going to use the JSON placeholder API as our source of data.

The two routes we'll be using from that API are:

- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/:id

In this section, we'll create a User Directory page, which lists all the users,
and a User Profile page, which shows the profile of a single user.

In order to facilitate fetching data, a generic `useFetch` function is supplied.
It is similar to the one proposed in the previous `useEffect` lab. You can find it in
the file `labs/07-react-router-dom/your-solution/02-url-params/useFetch.jsx`

First, let's define shell components for our two routes. Add this code to `App.jsx`.

```jsx
const AllUsers = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      All users list
    </div>
  )
}

const SingleUser = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      Show single user
    </div>
  )
}
```

And add a Routes component to the return statement of the App component:

( Don't forget to import the `Routes` and `Route` component from `react-router-dom` )

```jsx
return (
  <div>
    <h1>User Directory</h1>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<AllUsers />} />
      <Route path="/users/:userId" element={<SingleUser />} />
    </Routes>
  </div>
);
```

Next, update the `AllUsers` component to fetch the users from the API and display them.

(Don't forget to import the `Link` component from `react-router-dom`)

```jsx
const AllUsers = () => {
  const users = useFetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users");

  return (
    <div>
      {users.isLoading && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {users.error && <p>{users.error.message}</p>}
      <ul>
        {users.data?.map((user) => (
          <li key={user.id}>
            <Link to={`/users/${user.id}`}>{user.username}</Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Now, you should see a list of users, and clicking on a user should take you to a page that says "Show single user".

Next, we can update the `SingleUser` component to fetch the user data from the API and display it.

You'll need to import the function `useParams` from `react-router-dom` to access the url params.

The SingleUser component should look like this:

```jsx
const SingleUser = () => {
  const params = useParams();
  const userId = params.userId;
  // notice that `userId` matches the parameter name specified in the route path
  // in this case, the route path is `/users/:userId`

  const user = useFetch(
    `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}`,
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <Link to="/">Back to all users</Link>
      {user.isLoading && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {user.error && <p>{user.error.message}</p>}
      {user.data && (
        <div>
          <div>Username: {user.data.username}</div>
          <div>Name: {user.data.name}</div>
          <div>Email: {user.data.email}</div>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

With that in place you should be able to navigate back and forth between
the listing page and the pages for individual users.
