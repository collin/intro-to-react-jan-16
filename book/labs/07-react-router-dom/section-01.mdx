A common pattern in React is the "Single Page App". This is where the entire application is
rendered in a single HTML page, and the page is updated by changing the DOM.

This is in contrast to the traditional web application, where each page is a separate
HTML document, and the browser navigates between them by loading a new page.

The library, 'react-router-dom' is used to implement routing in React. This library
provides a number of components that can be used to define routes, and to navigate
between them.

To the right side of this page is a live preview of what you'll be working on
in this lab. The code for this lab is in the file `labs/07-react-router-dom/your-solution/01-simple-routes`;

The first thing to do is import the routing and link Components from `react-router-dom`. Add this to the top of the `App.jsx` file:

```js
import { Routes, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";
```

- The `Routes` component is used to wrap all the defined the routes in your application.
- The `Route` component is used to define individual routes.
- The `Link` component is used to create links between routes.

In this lab, you'll be building a very bare-bones site with three pages:

- `/` - The home page
- `/about` - A page with "About" text
- `/contact` - A page with "Contact" text

As a first step, we'll need components for each of these pages.

In a larger application, it would be typical to put these in their own files, but for simplicity, we'll put them
all in the `App.jsx` file.

Add the following components to the `App.jsx` file:

```js
const Home = () => {
  return <h2>Home</h2>;
};
const About = () => {
  return <h2>About</h2>;
};
const Contact = () => {
  return <h2>Contact</h2>;
};
```

( Because our focus is on routing, we won't worry about putting much content in these components. )

Next, we'll define the routes for these components.

The `Routes` component is used to wrap all the defined the routes in your application.

Change the `return` statement in the `App` component to look like this:

```js
return (
  <div>
    <h1>Simple Site with Routes</h1>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
    </Routes>
  </div>
);
```

Now, you should see the "Home" component displayed on the page. That's because by default, the page was loaded
with the URL `/`, and the first route that matches is the one that renders.

But what if you want to navigate to the other pages?

The `Link` component is used to create links between routes.

We'll need to create a navigation bar with links to the other pages.

Update the `return` statement in the `App` component to look like this:

```js
return (
  <div>
    <h1>Simple Site with Routes</h1>
    <nav>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
    </nav>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
    </Routes>
  </div>
);
```

Now, you should see a navigation bar with links to the other pages. When you click on those links,
the appropriate component should be displayed.

This is good, but can be even better. There isn't any visual indication in the navbar of which page
is currently being displayed.

React Router provides a `NavLink` component that can be used to create links that have an html classname
applied when the link is active.

Update the import statement at the top of the `App.jsx` file to look like this:

```js
import { Routes, Route, Link, NavLink } from "react-router-dom";
```

Then, update the `nav` element in the `App` component to replace all the `<Link>` components with `<NavLink>` components.

It'll look like this when you're done:

```js
<nav>
  <NavLink to="/">Home</NavLink>
  <NavLink to="/about">About</NavLink>
  <NavLink to="/contact">Contact</NavLink>
</nav>
```

That updates the links in the navbar, but we also need to include some CSS to style the active link.

There is a file called `styles.css` in the `labs/07-react-router-dom/your-solution/01-simple-routes` directory.

We'll need to include it in our application and add some extra styles for nav links to it.

Add the following import statement to the top of the `App.jsx` file:

```js
import "./styles.css";
```

Then, add the following CSS to the `styles.css` file:

```css
a.active {
  color: white;
  background: black;
}
```

That will target all links with the `active` class and set the text color to white and the background color to black.

With that change in place, you should see the active link in the navbar highlighted as you click them.

One last thing, we'll add a "Not Found" page that will be displayed when the user somehow navigates to a page that doesn't exist.

Add the following component to the `App.jsx` file:

```js
const NotFound = () => {
  return <h2>Not Found</h2>;
};
```

Then, add a `<Route>` component to the `Routes` component that will match any path that hasn't already been matched.

It'll look like this when you're done:

```js
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
  <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
  <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
</Routes>
