Take a look to the right.

You'll see a convenient browser preview.

From here on out, each lab comes with some of the basic starter
code you created in the first lab.

You won't have to create the `index.html` file or the `main.jsx` file
or run the `vite dev` command for each lab going forward. Everything will be
served from the book unless otherwise specified.

As I publish my solutions, you'll be able switch between my and your solutions too.

There's no code editor here, so you will need to open the project in your own editor.
But the live-reload and console output will be here, right next to the instructions.
