  In this section, you will
  
- add event listeners to react elements

  Once you've read through that, come back and apply some event listeners here.

To the right of these instructions is a live preview of the code
in the folder: `labs/04-event-handlers/your-solution`.

During tihs lab, you will be making edits to the code in that folder.

<Activity>

1. Add a `click` handler to the element with the text "Click me."
  _In that handler,  include `console.log("I was clicked")` to send a message to the console._


2. Add a `doubleclick` handler to the element with the text "Double click me."
  _In that handler, include `console.log("I was doubleclicked")` to send a message to the console._

3. Add a `mousemove` handler to the element with the text "Move your mouse over me."
  _In that handler,  include `console.log("I was moused over")` to send a message to the console._

4. Add a `change` handler to the color picker input.
  _In that handler, log the chosen color to the console._

5. Add a `keydown` handler to the input near the text "Log keypresses here."
  _In that handler, log the `event.key` to the console._

<Hint title="How to read the chosen color out of the event?">

Change events on input elements have a `target` property that refers to the element that triggered the event. The `value` property of that element is the chosen color.

```jsx
<input
  type="color"
  onChange={(event) => {
    console.log(event.target.value);
  }}
/>
```

</Hint>

<Hint title="How to read the pressed key out of the event?"></Hint>

Keyboard events have a `key` property that refers to the key that was pressed.

```jsx
<input
  type="color"
  onChange={(event) => {
    // mark[17:34]
    console.log(event.key);
  }}
/>
```

</Activity>

<LookAtBrowser>

Look at the log output under the preview to see the results of your event handlers.
When you see all the messages you expect, you're done with this activity.

<Goal>

Great news! You've handled some events in React!

### `event.preventDefault`

A word on `event.preventDefault`: The browser defines some built-in behavior for certain events.

For example:

- When you click on a link, the browser navigates to the URL in the `href` attribute of the link.
- When you submit a form, the browser sends the form data to the URL in the `action` attribute of the form.

These two behaviors are particularly important for web applications. The default behavior of these navigation
events is to reload the page, completely resetting the state of the application.

Often, when building javascript applications, we want to override this default behavior.
For example, we might want to build a network request with custom headers or other settings.
In these circumstances, we can call `event.preventDefault` to prevent the browser from doing its default behavior.
