Typically, React components are written in a declarative style, where you describe
what you want to happen, and React takes care of the DOM updates. However,
sometimes you need to access the underlying DOM node, and this is done by using a
reference.

In this example, we will use the html `<canvas>` element to gain access to a 2d
graphics drawing api. Drawing to this api can not be done declaratively with HTML,
so we can't use JSX to do it. Instead, we will use a reference to the canvas.

The the right of this page, you'll see a live preview of what you're building.

The starting point can be found in in the directory: `labs/06-useEffect/your-solution/canvas-draw`.
You'll be making changes in the `App.jsx` file.

First, let's update the `App` component to render a `<canvas>` element.

Do that by changing the `return` statement to the following:

```jsx
return (
  <div>
    <h1>Drawing Canvas</h1>
    <canvas
      width={400} height={400}
      style={{ border: '1px solid black' }}
    />
  </div>
)
```

Now, to make a reference, we'll need the `useRef` hook. Add the following line to the top of 
the `App` component:

( Dont forget to  `import { useRef } from 'react'`)

```jsx
export const App = () => {
  const canvasRef = useRef(null);
```

We'll need to connect this reference to the `<canvas>` element. Update the `<canvas>` element
to use the reference, like this:

```jsx
<canvas
  ref={canvasRef}
  width={400} height={400}
  style={{ border: '1px solid black' }}
/>
```

Now, we can use our ref along with `useEffect` to draw to the canvas.

First, update your imports from 'react' to include `useEffect`:

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
```

Then, add the following `useEffect` hook to the `App` component:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const canvas = canvasRef.current;
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

  // Clear the canvas
  ctx.fillStyle = "white";
  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

  const radius = 100;
  const color = "red";

  // Draw a circle with the given radius and color
  ctx.fillStyle = color;
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(200, 200, radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  ctx.fill();
}, []);
```

With that effect, your component should now draw a red circle to
the canvas upon it's first render.

## Dynamic drawing

Now, let's make the drawing dynamic. We'll do this by adding a `color` and `radius` state to our component.

Add `useState` to your imports from react, and add the following lines to the top of the `App` component:

```jsx
const [color, setColor] = useState("red");
const [radius, setRadius] = useState(100);
```

Now, we can use these values in our `useEffect` hook. Update the `useEffect` hook to use the `color` and `radius` state:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const canvas = canvasRef.current;
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

  // Clear the canvas
  ctx.fillStyle = "white";
  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

  // Draw a circle with the given radius and color
  ctx.fillStyle = color;
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(200, 200, radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  ctx.fill();
}, [color, radius]);
```

Note that the `color` and `radius` have been added to the dependency array of the `useEffect` hook.
This means that the effect will be run whenever the `color` or `radius` changes.

Now, we can add some controls to change the color and radius.

Update the JSX of the App component to include `<input>` elements for color and radius:

```jsx
return (
  <div>
    <h1>Drawing Canvas</h1>
    <canvas ref={canvasRef} width="400" height="400" />
    <input
      type="range"
      min="10"
      max="150"
      value={radius}
      onChange={(event) => setRadius(event.target.valueAsNumber)}
    />
    <input
      type="color"
      value={color}
      onChange={(event) => setColor(event.target.value)}
    />
  </div>
);
```

Now, you should be able to change the color and radius of the circle by using the controls.

Most of the time you'll be able to use React's declarative style to build your UI, but
it's useful to have access to the underlying DOM node as an "escape hatch" when you need it.
