## Setup & Launch Vite Bundler

Let's get started with react.

For this lab, we're using the `vite` bundler. There'll be quite a bit unexplained in this lab. We're looking to build something small,but functional.

If you don't wholly understand what you're doing, that's okay. **_Bring those questions to the review_** We'll dig deeper into every part of this throughout the lectures and labs to follow.

For this lab, you'll be making all your changes, and doing all your work from the `labs/01-hello-world/your-solution` directory

The first thing we'll need is an `index.html` in that folder.

<CopyPaste>
  Go ahead and copy/paste this example. Later examples will call out when to
  type it out by-hand
</CopyPaste>

<br />

```html index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Hello World</title>
    <script defer type="module" src="/main.jsx"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

In that file, pay close attention to two elements in particular:

- ```html
  <script defer type="module" src="/main.jsx">
  ```
- ```html
  <div id="root">`</div>
  ```

<Questions>
  You might have questions about those elements, make a note and bring them to
  review. Or if you finish the lab early, that's a good time to do some
  searching.
</Questions>

That html file references a `main.js` file. You'll also need to create that file in your solution folder.

To get started, we're going to need a terminal to build and serve our react code.

A quick way to get a terminal open is to right click on `labs/01-hello-world/your-solution` in the VSCode file explorer and click "Open in Integrated Terminal"

<img className="mw-500 center" src={openTerminal} />

You should see something like this:

<img className="mw-500 center" src={openedTerminal} />

In that terminal, start the vite dev server.

```zsh
npx vite dev
```

<Questions>
  `npx` is a tool that comes with `npm`. It's a way to run a command without
  installing it globally. If you have questions about `npx` bring them to
  review.
</Questions>

You should see this output indicating vite is bundling and serving your code at `localhost:5173` or a similar port.

<img className="mw-500 center" src={viteStarted} />

If you open that page, and open your browser's dev tools...

<img className="w-400 h-300 center crop-bottom" src={inspectMenu} />

You'll see your html has been loaded.

<img className="w-600 center" src={devTools} />

<Goal>You've successfully started a vite dev server and loaded your html.</Goal>
