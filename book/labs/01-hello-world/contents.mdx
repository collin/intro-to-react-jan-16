<Objectives>

In this Lab, we'll setup our project and launch the vite dev server.

This first Lab will be a little bit of a dive into the deep-end.

Ô∏è You're not expected to fully understand everything you do in this first lab.

Goals:

- Get comfortable with the process of going through a Lab, working through the steps and re-convening for a review.
- Build something small, but complete enough to give you a a sense the development cycle of working with React.
- Collect a list of questions about the material and **_Bring those questions to the review_**
