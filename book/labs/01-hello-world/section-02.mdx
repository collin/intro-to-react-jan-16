<Objectives>
  In this section, you will:
  
- add the react libraries to our project
- and render a "Hello World" message to the page.

</Objectives>

## Add React

Now we're ready to start writing some react code.

<ByHand>Type things out by-hand in this section.</ByHand>

<br />

In `main.jsx` we're going to import the `react` and `react-dom` libraries. These have already been installed in this repository, so you don't need to do anything to install them. But typically this would be done with `npm install react react-dom`

```js main.jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
```

Next, we'll need to get a reference to the `div` with the id of `root` in our html. And we'll need to create a react root targeting that element.

```js
const root = document.getElementById("root");
const reactRoot = ReactDOM.createRoot(root);
```

Now we're ready to render our first react component to that root:

```js
reactRoot.render(<h1>Hello World</h1>, root);
```

<LookAtBrowser>

Go ahead and save that file, and you should see your browser has reloaded with
the new content. This is because vite is watching for changes to your code and
automatically reloading the page.

</LookAtBrowser>

<Goal>
  You've imported the react libraries, created a react root and rendered some
  content out!
