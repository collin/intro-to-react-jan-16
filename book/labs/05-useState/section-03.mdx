<Objectives>
<div>
  In this section, you will
  
- Use an array with `useState`

</div>
</Objectives>

### Rendering arrays:

Remember how we couldn't use an `if` statement in JSX? We can't use a `for` loop either for the same reason.
But we can use `map`:

<LiveCode
  disabled
  noWrap
  code={`function DaysOfTheWeak () {
  const days = [
      "Monday", "Tuesday",
      "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday",
      "Saturday", "Sunday"
  ];

  return (
    <ol>
      {days.map(day => <li>{day}</li>)}
    </ol>
  )
}`}
/>

<Activity>
  - Add a `useState` for the current time.
  - Add a button to add a new time to the list. (`new Date().toLocaleTimeString()`)
  - Render the list of times.

<Hint title="How to initialize state?">

Initialize with an empty array:

```jsx
const [times, setTimes] = useState([]);
```

</Hint>

<Hint title="How to add to state?">

```jsx
<button onClick={() => {
  setTimes([...times, new Date().toLocaleTimeString()]);
}}>
  Add current time
</div>
```

</Hint>

</Activity>

## Immutable arrays

Best practice in React is to never mutate state. In the case of an array, that means not
using methods like `push`. Instead, we copy the prior state, and add the new item to the copy.

We can use the `...` spread operator to copy the array, and then add the new item to the end:

```jsx
const array = [1, 2, 3];
const newArray = [...array, 4];
```

That is equivalent to:

```jsx
const array = [1, 2, 3];
const newArray = array.slice(); // slice with no arguments copies the array
newArray.push(4);
```

## Removing items from an array

We can use the `filter` method to remove items from an array:

```jsx
const array = [1, 2, 3];
const newArray = array.filter(item => item !== 2); // Copies the array, and removes the item
```

Alright, you've practiced how to use arrays with `useState`. Now let's learn how to copy and update objects.

<Activity>

Update your code to add a button to each timestamp to remove it from the list.

</Activity>


## Copying and updating objects

```jsx
const john = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 42
};

const olderJohn = {
  ...person,
  age: 43
};

const johnWithTitle = {
  ...person,
  name: "John Doe, Esq."
};
```

These examples copy the original data into a new objectwith the `...` spread operator,
and then update a property.

This technique can also be used to add new properties.

## Removing properties

```jsx

const john = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 42
};

const { age, ...timelessJohn } = john;
```

This example uses destructuring to remove the `age` property from the `john` object.

In that example, all the properties except `age` are copied into the `timelessJohn` object.
