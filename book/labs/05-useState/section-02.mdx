</div>

</Objectives>

Consider the following code:

Before you click the Add 2 button, think for a moment about what you expect to happen when you click it.

Why do you think that will happen?

<LiveCode
  disabled
  noWrap
  code={`function Adder() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <>
    <p>Count: {count}</p>
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        setCount(count + 1);
        setCount(count + 1);
      }}
    >
      Add 2
    </button>
  </>
}`}
/>

Okay, now click the Add 2 button. What happened? Did it surprise you?

The reason this happens is because the variable named `count` contains the value
of the state at the time the function was called. When you call `setCount` with
a new value, it doesn't update the value of `count`.

It updates the internal state, and then it schedules a re-render of the component.
When the component re-renders, value of the state will be the new value.

Another way to think about it is this:

```jsx
// First click
setCount(0 + 1);
setCount(0 + 1);

// Second click
setCount(0 + 1);
setCount(0 + 1);
```

Let's try another. This time, we'll add a `console.log` to see more about what's happening,
and when the component re-renders.

Take a moment to read this through and think about what you expect to happen when you click the button.

<LiveCode
  disabled
  noWrap
  code={`function Adder() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  console.log("Rendering Adder. Count is", count);
  return <>
    <p>Count: {count}</p>
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          console.log("Adding 1 to count 1000ms later");
          setCount(count + 1);
        }, 1000);

        setTimeout(() => {
          console.log("Adding 1 to count 2000ms later");
          setCount(count + 1);
        }, 2000);
      }}
    >
      Add 2
    </button>

  </>
}`}
/>

Okay, now click the Add 2 button. What happened? Did it surprise you?

Even though we used a timeout here, the same thing happens. The value of `count` is
the value of the state at the time the timeout was scheduled. This is because of how
closures work in JavaScript. The function that is passed to `setTimeout` closes over
the value of `count` at the time it was scheduled, so it con't possibly be influenced
by any future renders as written.

But we can work around this. We can use the function form of `setCount` to update the count.

```jsx
setCount((count) => count + 1);
```

With that form, the function passed to `setCount` is called with the value of the state
at the time it is being set, it will always be the most recent value.

<LiveCode
  disabled
  noWrap
  code={`function Adder() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  console.log("Rendering Adder. Count is", count);
  return <>
    <p>Count: {count}</p>
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          console.log("Adding 1 to count 1000ms later");
          setCount((count) => count + 1);
        }, 1000);

        setTimeout(() => {
          console.log("Adding 1 to count 2000ms later");
          setCount((count) => count + 1);
        }, 2000);
      }}
    >
      Add 2
    </button>

  </>
}`}
/>

Mash that button to your heart's content, and you'll see that the count always goes up by 2 times
as many times as you clicked it.
