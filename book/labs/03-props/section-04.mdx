In HTML and CSS, styles can be applied to an element in a variety of ways.

- Inline styles
- Styles in a `<style>` tag
- Styles in a separate CSS file

In React, styles can be applied in the same ways. In this lab, we'll focus on inline styles.

In HTML, inline styles are applied using the `style` attribute using a string of CSS properties.

```html
<div style="color: red; font-size: 24px;">Hello World... in red</div>
```

In React, inline styles are applied using the `style` attribute using a JavaScript object of CSS properties.

<LiveCode
  disabled
  code={`<div
  style={{
    color: "red",
    fontSize: "24px",
  }}
>
  Hello World... in red
</div>`}
/>

<Activity>
Create a component that renders a `<div>` with the text "Hello World" in red.

Add it to the `App` component.

</Activity>

<Goal>Congratulations! You've styled a component with inline-props.</Goal>

Note that `props.style` is an object, not a string. This is because the `style`
attribute in HTML is a string of CSS properties, but in React, it's a JavaScript object of CSS properties.

There's another difference between HTML and React. In HTML, elements can be given an attribute
called `class` to apply a CSS class to an element. In React, the attribute is called `className`.

In HTML:

```html
<div className="cool-div"></div>
```

In JSX:

```jsx
<div className="cool-div">
```

We'll take a look more styling options, including classnames a later section.
