- use `props.children` to create re-usable components

</div>

</Objectives>

JSX has a special property called `children` that allows you to pass in
components as children of other components. This is useful for creating
re-usable components that can be used in different contexts.

For example, a component that prefixes content with a title `h1` tag could be
written like this:

```jsx
const Content = ({ title, children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};
```

Then, you can use the `Content` component like this:

<LiveCode
  disabled
  scope={{ Content: ({ title, children }) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        {children}
      </div>
    );
  }}}
  code={
`<Content title="Chapter 1">
  <p>It was the best of times...</p>
</Content>

<Content title="Chapter 2">
  <p>It was the worst of times...</p>
</Content>
`}/>

<Activity>
Create a re-usable component that combines the `style` prop with the `children` prop.

Create a `<ColorBox>` component that takes a `color` prop and passes its children through.

Use the color prop to set the background color of the box.

Wrap some of the components in the `App` component with the `<ColorBox>` component and make things colorful.

<Hint title="How to combine `style` and `children`?">

```jsx
const ColorBox = ({ color, children }) => {
  return (
    <div style={{ backgroundColor: color, padding: "1rem" }}>{children}</div>
  );
};
```

<Goal>Nice! You've used `props.children` to create re-usable components.</Goal>
