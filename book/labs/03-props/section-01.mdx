- Use `number` properties in a react component

First, open a folder `labs/03-props/your-solution` and explore the file structur.

Take a look at the starter-code provided in this lab. It should feel familiar to you by now.

<Activity>

Create a new component in its own file called `SimpleProps.jsx`.

Import that component into the `App.jsx` file and render it.

<LookAtBrowser>
When you're done, you should see the following in your browser:

<img className="mw-400" src={simpleProps1} />

</LookAtBrowser>

<Hint title="Not sure how to create that file?">
You can right click on the `your-solution` folder and select `New File`.

<img className="mw-400" src={newFile}/>
</Hint>

<Hint title="Not sure how to write that code?">

In the `SimpleProps.jsx` file, write the following code:

```jsx SimpleProps.jsx
export const SimpleProps = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Simple Props</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

And import it into the `App.jsx` file, and render it inside the `App` component.

```jsx App.jsx
// focus
import { SimpleProps } from "./SimpleProps";

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      // focus
      <h1>My App</h1>
      // focus
      <SimpleProps />
    </div>
  );
};
```

</Hint>

</Activity>

Great, now we'll add some props to the `SimpleProps` component.

We'll update the component to render some dynamic content passed in as props.

<Activity>

Update your `SimpleProps` component to take the following props:

- `title` - a string
- `description` - a string
- `count` - a number

And render them inside the component.

- `title` should be rendered inside the `h1` tag.
- `description` should be rendered inside a new `p` tag.
- `count` should be rendered inside a new `p` tag.

Then, update the `App` component to render two instances of the `SimpleProps` component.
Each instance should have different props passed into it.

<LookAtBrowser>
When you're done, you should see something like the following in your browser:

<img className="mw-400" src={simpleProps2} />
</LookAtBrowser>

<Hint title="Not sure how to write that code?">

In the `SimpleProps.jsx` file, write the following code:

```jsx SimpleProps.jsx
export const SimpleProps = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
      <p>{props.description}</p>
      <p>{props.count}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

And import it into the `App.jsx` file, and render it inside the `App` component.

```jsx App.jsx
import { SimpleProps } from "./SimpleProps";

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      // focus(1:4)
      <SimpleProps
        title="My First Props"
        description="This is my first props"
        count={1}
      />
      // focus(1:4)
      <SimpleProps
        title="My Second Props"
        description="This is my second props"
        count={2}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

</Hint>

</Activity>

<Goal>
  Congratulations! You've created a component that takes props and renders them
  dynamically.
</Goal>

Before we move on, let's take a look at the `SimpleProps` component and see if
we can make it a bit simpler.

We're going to update the `SimpleProps` component to use destructuring to extract the props
from the `props` object.

This is a common pattern in React, so it's worth getting familiar with it. Many future examples in
this course will use this pattern.

First, here's an example of destructuring assignment in JavaScript:

```jsx
const person = { age: 21, name: "John" };

// This destructuring syntax
const { age, name } = person;

// has the same effect same as this syntax
const age = person.age;
const name = person.name;
```

This can also be used to extract properties from arguments, such as the `props` argument
in our `SimpleProps` component.

```jsx
export const SimpleProps = (props) => {
  // This destructuring syntax
  const { title, description, count } = props;

  // has the same effect same as this syntax
  const title = props.title;
  const description = props.description;
  const count = props.count;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{description}</p>
      <p>{count}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

So we can simplify our `SimpleProps` component to the following:

```jsx
export const SimpleProps = (props) => {
  const { title, description, count } = props;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{description}</p>
      <p>{count}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

But we can simplify it even further. Instead of extracting the properties from the `props` object
in a separate step, we can do it in the function arguments.

```jsx
export const SimpleProps = ({ title, description, count }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{description}</p>
      <p>{count}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Again, this is a common pattern in the React world, so it's worth getting familiar with it.
