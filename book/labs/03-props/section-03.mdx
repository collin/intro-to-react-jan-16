  In this section, you will

- use the spread operator pass multiple props through a component

</div>

</Objectives>

JSX has a special syntax for passing several to a component at once. It's called the spread operator, and it looks like this:

```jsx
const props = {
  name: "John",
  age: 42,
  occupation: "developer",
};
<Profile {...props} />

// is equivalent to

<Profile name="John" age={42} occupation="developer" />
```

<Activity>

In an erlier section, in `App.jsx` file, you created two instances of the `<SimpleProps>` component.

```jsx
  <SimpleProps
    title="My First Props"
    description="This is my first props"
    count={1}
  />
  <SimpleProps
    title="My Second Props"
    description="This is my second props"
    count={2}
  />
```

Rewrite those two instances using the spread operator instead of passing each prop individually.

<Hint title="How to rewrite props using ...spread">

It'll look something like this:

```jsx
const simple1 = {
  title: "My First Props",
  description: "This is my first props",
  count: 1,
};

const simple2 = {
  title: "My Second Props",
  description: "This is my second props",
  count: 2,
};

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <SimpleProps {...simple1} />
      <SimpleProps {...simple2} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

</Hint>

</Activity>

When you're done, you should see the same output as before.

Keep in mind, this isn't a great example of using the spread operator. It's just a way to get familiar with the syntax,
so you'll understand it if you see it.

In later sections, you'll see how the spread operator can be used to pass props to a component in a more useful way.
