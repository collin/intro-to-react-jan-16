<Objectives>
<div>
  In this section, you will
  
- Use `boolean` properties in a react component
- Conditionally render depending on the value of a `boolean` property

</div>

</Objectives>

Now, we're going to create another component to practice using `boolean` properties and conditional rendering.

<Activity>

Next to your `SimpleProps` component, create a new file called `AreThingsGood.js`.

Inside it, export component called `AreThingsGood` that renders a `<div>` with the text "Things are good" inside it.

Then, in your `App.js` file, import your new component and render it below your `SimpleProps` component.

<LookAtBrowser>
  When you're done, your app should look like this:

  <img className="mw-400" src={booleanProps1} />
</LookAtBrowser>

</Activity>

Now we're going to add a boolean to our `AreThingsGood` component.

With the `string` and `number` properties we made before, we had to use a key and a value, like:

```jsx
<SimpleProps count={10} />
<SimpleProps title="A Title" />
```

We can do the same with boolean props, like:

```jsx
<AreThingsGood isGood={true} />
<AreThingsGood isGood={false} />
```

But, we can also just use the name of the property, like `<AreThingsGood isGood>`

```jsx
<AreThingsGood isGood /> === <AreThingsGood isGood={true} />
<AreThingsGood /> === <AreThingsGood isGood={false} />
```

<Activity>

Update your `AreThingsGood` component so that it has a boolean property called `isGood`.

Then, update your `App.js` file to render two `AreThingsGood` components, one with the `isGood` property and one without.

<Hint title="How to add the boolean props.">

```jsx AreThingsGood.jsx focus=1[29:41]
export const AreThingsGood = ({ isGood }) => {
  return <div>Things are good</div>;
};
```

```jsx App.js
import { AreThingsGood } from "./AreThingsGood";

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <SimpleProps count={10} />
      <SimpleProps title="A Title" />
      // focus(1:2)
      <AreThingsGood isGood />
      <AreThingsGood />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Conditional rendering

### Ternary

Great, now we have a boolean property in our component. But, we're not using it yet.

Let's update our `AreThingsGood` component so that it renders a different message depending on the value of the `isGood` property.

In JavaScript, we would use an `if` statement to conditionally run code.

```js
if (isGood) {
  console.log("Things are good");
}
```

In JSX, we can't use `if` statements inside JSX content.

For example, this wouldn't work, because an if statement doesn't have a value.

```jsx
const AreThingsGood = ({ isGood }) => {
  return <div>This are ${if (isGood) {} "good" } else {  "bad" }}</div>;
};
```

Instead, we use a ternary operator.

```jsx
const AreThingsGood = ({ isGood }) => {
  return <div>This are ${isGood ? "good" : "bad"}</div>;
};
```

Conditional rendering is a common pattern in React. We use it to render different content depending on the state of our application.

### Logical &&

Sometimes, we want to render content depending on the value of a boolean property, but we don't want to render anything if the property is `false`.

We can do this using the logical `&&` operator.

```jsx
const AreThingsGood = ({ isGood }) => {
  return <div>{isGood && <div>Things are good</div>}</div>;
};
```
